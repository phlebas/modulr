Modulr Finance technical test submission.

Anthony Cunningham (tjc@alpha-60.co.uk)

This solution is written in Java 8 and uses Maven as its 
build system. Also included is an IntelliJ project file 
which can also be used to open the project.

Tests are written using JUnit5 and can be executed with
the command:

'mvn test'

on the command line. 

There is a coverage report in the folder 'Code Coverage Report'

Logging is handled by SLF4J and is directed to both the console
and a file, 'ATMServiceLog.txt'

Thank you for taking the time to consider this submission.
